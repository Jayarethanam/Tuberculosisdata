About this Dataset
Content and context
Tuberculosis is a disease that affects many people in developing countries. While treatment is possible, it requires an accurate diagnosis first. In these countries projects there are in many cases available X-ray machines (through low-cost projects and donations), but often the radiological expertise is missing for accurately assessing the images. An algorithm that could perform this task quickly and cheaply could drastically improve the ability to diagnose and ultimately treat the disease.

In more developed countries, X-ray radiography is often used for screening new arrivals and determining eligibility for a work-permit. The task of manually examining images is time consuming and an algorithm could increase efficiency, improve performance and ultimately reduce cost of this screening.

This dataset contains over 500 x-rays scans with clinical labels collected by radiologists.
